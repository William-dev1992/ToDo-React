# About the app

This is a new version of the [To-do-list](https://github.com/William-dev1992/To-do-list) app that I've done, but this time using react.js. 

This is an app where you can put up items, activities, dayly-marks or anything that you need or want to do.
You're able to mark your actvities as "Done" or "Not done" and delete any item if you want.
